# Test

Just some verbose text with some links inside the file to test the [markdown link check](#get-started). 
It seems like there is a problem with sections that contain spaces? [No Problems here](#sectionwithnospaces).

--> It was a version issue. All good.

## Other tests

What happens when only checking changed files and a file is deleted? Does the check show a broken link in the unchanged file that refers to the [deleted file](./docs/testfile2.md)?

## Get Started

- **[Google](https://google.com)**: Search Engine.
